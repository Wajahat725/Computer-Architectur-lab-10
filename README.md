🧠 Computer Architecture Lab 10 – 4-Bit CPU in Logisim
🔎 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a simple 4-bit CPU built using Logisim. It is an educational processor designed to reinforce core concepts of computer architecture, digital logic, and CPU design.

🔧 Components Implemented:
🧮 4-bit Program Counter (PC)

📥 4-bit Instruction Register (IR)

🧭 Control Unit

➗ 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

📦 Two General-Purpose Registers

💾 Simple Memory Module (ROM/RAM)

🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Requirements
Download Logisim on your system (Logisim Evolution is recommended).

🚀 Getting Started
Step-by-Step Guide:
Set Up the Project
Open the provided .circ file in Logisim.

Design the Components
Each component (PC, IR, ALU, etc.) is modular and can be studied or modified individually.

Instruction Set Design
A basic instruction set is used, including arithmetic, load/store, and jump operations. (Instruction set details can be added here if available.)

Connect Components
The CPU integrates all components in a top-level circuit to allow instruction fetching, decoding, and execution.

Test the CPU
Run simple test programs to observe CPU behavior and validate execution.
